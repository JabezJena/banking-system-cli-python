# 🏦 Mini Project: Banking System (CLI)

A command-line banking system built with Python by **Jabez Jesudason Jena**. This mini project demonstrates how object-oriented programming can be used to simulate basic bank operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checking.

## ✨ Features

- Class-based structure (`Bank`)

300 has been withdrawn!

Current balance: 700.0
